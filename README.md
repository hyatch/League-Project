League of Legends Draft Classfier and Predictor

This is my first unsupervised project as a programmer in this space. 

The goal of this project is to be able to do 2 different things:
1. Recommend the next pick in a League of Legends Draft based on pro play activity. 
2. Classify the champions inside the draft. 

Users will upload a screenshot of a League of Legneds Ranked Draft. A CNN architecture will attempt to formulate features from the picture and allow our program to recommend the best champion based on pro play drafts. The picture should be taken inside the League of Legends Client for Champion Select, not any 3rd-party mock draft simulators.
